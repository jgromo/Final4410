This is a group project for our final project for CSE 4410 - Game Programming. The game is basic FPS movement with an enemy AI script and some level design. There is also an inventory in later versions of the game. 
See the other branches for more updates. Everything is done in Unity and some royalty-free assets are used from the Unity Store.
